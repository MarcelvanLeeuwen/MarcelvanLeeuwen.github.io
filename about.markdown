From a young age, I have been fascinated by everything related to computers and servers. Over the years, I have gained broad experience with various platforms and systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, DSM, SRM, and Unifi.

I enjoy working with virtualization, container technology, network management, and storage solutions. That’s why I take great pleasure in building my production homelab, setting up Proxmox environments, and running and managing containers and virtual machines.

I run several projects in production, such as Flux, a decentralized cloud solution, and Presearch, a privacy-focused search engine.

Over the past few months, I’ve been learning how to use Kubernetes in my production homelab. I’ve always been fascinated by container technologies. I have a yearly subscription to KodeKloud, which allows you to immediately put your new knowledge into practice through hands on labs.

I am also considering making a career switch and turning my hobby into my profession. In April and May, I completed an internship at RotaForm in the Infrastructure and Management department. This experience was very rewarding, and I really enjoyed working with people who share the same passion for IT.

For me, IT is more than just a hobby; it is a passion and a constant source of learning, experimenting, and improving.
