Today during my CKA training on KodeKloud I came across a very useful feature again: You can assign resources to your Pods, just like you would with virtual machines. Kubernetes lets you set

âœ… Requests â€” the minimum amount of CPU and memory a container is guaranteed
âœ… Limits â€” the maximum amount itâ€™s allowed to use

This helps the scheduler place pods efficiently and ensures your apps donâ€™t hog more resources than they should. ðŸ”’

Itâ€™s small details like these that show how powerful Kubernetes is when it comes to fine-grained resource control.

Every day Iâ€™m learning something newâ€”and I love how Kubernetes combines flexibility with stability. ðŸ™Œ

    matchLabels:
      app: resource-demo

      labels:
        app: resource-demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: demo-container
        image: nginx:stable
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```
